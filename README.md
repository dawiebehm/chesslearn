# chesslearn
Attempt at creating a chess engine based on players from chess.com

The main goal of this porject is to learn and keep sharp. Eventualy I would like to lift and shift this project from Swing to something a bit more modern, such as a swing infrastructure and a react interface. Along with the different technologies, I want to implement some sort of machine learning AI, by using the chess.com database as a source of data points.

For now its baby steps :)
